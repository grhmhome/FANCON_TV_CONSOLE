Repository for my cartridge based Raspberry Pi console that uses 3.5" floppies.

This is a work in progress page. More information will be provided soon.
The scripts provided will allow you to turn your Raspberry Pi in a cartridge based console that utilizes 3.5" floppies.

The wiki page has instructions on how to build. Everything is still in beta, so expect file changes.

This should work with Pico8, but may also work for TIC-80 (unsupported at the moment)


USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
